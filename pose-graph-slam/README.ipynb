    "# Graph-based SLAM Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise contains an implementation of Graph-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) that processes both simulated and real-world datasets. The implementation handles both pose-pose constraints and pose-landmark constraints to optimize robot trajectories and landmark positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system implements a least-squares optimization approach to SLAM using graph-based formulation. It supports:\n",
    "- 2D robot poses (x, y, Î¸)\n",
    "- 2D landmark positions (x_l, y_l)\n",
    "- Pose-pose constraints between robot positions\n",
    "- Pose-landmark constraints between robot poses and observed landmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation has been tested on four different datasets:\n",
    "1. `simulation-pose-pose.g2o`: Simulated data with only pose-pose constraints\n",
    "2. `simulation-pose-landmark.g2o`: Simulated data with both pose-pose and pose-landmark constraints\n",
    "3. `intel.g2o`: Real-world data from Intel Research Lab with pose-pose constraints\n",
