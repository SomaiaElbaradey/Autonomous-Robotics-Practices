    "# Occupancy Grid Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "**Occupancy Grid Mapping** is a fundamental technique in robotics and computer vision used for spatial representation and environment mapping. It is particularly prevalent in applications such as autonomous navigation, robot localization, and path planning. The primary goal of occupancy grid mapping is to build a map of an environment, typically a 2D or 3D space, by representing it as a grid of cells where each cell holds a probability that indicates whether the cell is occupied by an obstacle, free, or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Occupancy Grid Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupancy grid mapping involves discretizing the environment into a grid where each cell represents a small area of space. The grid cells are typically square in 2D grids or cubic in 3D grids. Each cell is associated with a probability value that represents the likelihood that the cell is occupied by an obstacle. The key idea is to update these probabilities based on sensor measurements as a robot or other agent explores the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications in Robotics and Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupancy grid mapping is crucial in various tasks within robotics and computer vision, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous Navigation**: Robots use occupancy grids to navigate safely through environments, avoiding obstacles and planning efficient paths.\n",
    "- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: Occupancy grids are often used in SLAM algorithms, where a robot simultaneously constructs a map of an unknown environment and localizes itself within that map.\n",
    "- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance**: Autonomous vehicles and drones rely on occupancy grids to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time.\n",
    "- **Environment Monitoring**: Occupancy grids are employed in surveillance and monitoring systems to map and track changes in an environment over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation of the Occupancy Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is represented as a grid $ G $, where each cell $ g_{ij} $ in the grid corresponds to a small region of space. The state of each cell can be described by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Occupied**: The cell is occupied by an obstacle.\n",
    "- **Free**: The cell is not occupied by any obstacle.\n",
    "- **Unknown**: There is no sufficient information to determine whether the cell is occupied or free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell $ g_{ij} $ is associated with a probability $ P(g_{ij}) $, which reflects the likelihood that the cell is occupied. These probabilities are typically updated incrementally as new sensor data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $ P(g_{ij}) $ of a cell being occupied can be represented mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(g_{ij}) = \\text{Pr}(g_{ij} = \\text{occupied} \\mid \\text{sensor data})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $ P(g_{ij}) $ ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ P(g_{ij}) = 1 $ indicates the cell is definitely occupied.\n",
    "- $ P(g_{ij}) = 0 $ indicates the cell is definitely free.\n",
    "- $ P(g_{ij}) = 0.5 $ indicates the cell is unknown or the probability is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian Update Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupancy grid mapping typically relies on **Bayesian inference** to update the probability of each cell being occupied as new sensor data is acquired. The Bayesian update rule is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(g_{ij} \\mid z_t, x_t) = \\frac{P(z_t \\mid g_{ij}, x_t) \\cdot P(g_{ij} \\mid x_t)}{P(z_t \\mid x_t)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ P(g_{ij} \\mid z_t, x_t) $ is the updated probability of the cell being occupied after observing sensor measurement $ z_t $ at time $ t $ given the robot's position $ x_t $.\n",
    "- $ P(z_t \\mid g_{ij}, x_t) $ is the likelihood of the sensor measurement given the cell's state and the robot's position.\n",
    "- $ P(g_{ij} \\mid x_t) $ is the prior probability of the cell being occupied before observing the new measurement.\n",
    "- $ P(z_t \\mid x_t) $ is the normalization factor, representing the overall probability of the sensor measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the logarithmic form of the Bayesian update rule, known as **log-odds**, is often used to simplify calculations and improve numerical stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{log-odds}(g_{ij}) = \\text{log-odds}(g_{ij}) + \\text{log}\\left(\\frac{P(z_t \\mid g_{ij}, x_t)}{1 - P(z_t \\mid g_{ij}, x_t)}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **log-odds** form allows the update process to be performed efficiently by adding instead of multiplying probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensor Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy and reliability of occupancy grid mapping depend heavily on the sensor model, which describes how sensor measurements relate to the occupancy state of the grid cells. Common sensors used in occupancy grid mapping include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)**: Lidar sensors provide accurate distance measurements to nearby obstacles, which can be used to update the occupancy grid.\n",
    "- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Commonly used in simpler robots, these sensors provide distance measurements based on sound waves.\n",
    "- **Cameras**: Vision-based sensors can be used to detect obstacles and free space by analyzing images.\n",
    "- **Radar**: Used in outdoor environments, radar provides information about distant obstacles and is less affected by environmental conditions such as fog or rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensor model defines how likely a sensor measurement is given the state of a cell. For example, if a Lidar beam returns a short distance, it is likely that the cell along the beam's path is occupied. The sensor model is crucial for updating the grid correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Occupancy Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing the Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "The occupancy grid is typically initialized with all cells set to an unknown state, with $ P(g_{ij}) = 0.5 $ for all cells. As the robot gathers data from its sensors, the grid is updated, and the probabilities of the cells being occupied or free are adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating the Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "As the robot moves through the environment, it collects sensor data, and the occupancy grid is updated according to the Bayesian update rule. The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensor Data Acquisition**:\n",
    "   - The robot collects data from its sensors at a given position $ x_t $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensor Model Application**:\n",
    "   - The sensor model is applied to the data to calculate the likelihood $ P(z_t \\mid g_{ij}, x_t) $ for each cell $ g_{ij} $ in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability Update**:\n",
    "   - The probability of each cell being occupied is updated using the Bayesian update rule or the log-odds form.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - This process is repeated continuously as the robot explores the environment, gradually refining the occupancy grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Dynamic Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "In dynamic environments, where obstacles may move or change over time, occupancy grid mapping must be adapted to account for these changes. Techniques such as **temporal filtering** or **dynamic occupancy grids** can be employed to update the grid in real-time, allowing the robot to adapt to changes in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map Resolution and Memory Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution of the occupancy grid, defined by the size of each cell, is a critical parameter that affects both the accuracy of the map and the computational resources required. Higher resolution maps provide more detailed information but require more memory and processing power. In practice, a balance is often struck between resolution and efficiency, depending on the specific application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Occupancy Grid Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility**: Occupancy grids can represent a wide range of environments, from indoor rooms to large outdoor spaces, and can be used with various types of sensors.\n",
    "- **Probabilistic Representation**: The probabilistic nature of occupancy grids allows for the incorporation of uncertainty and noise in sensor data, leading to more robust mapping.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Occupancy grids can be scaled to different resolutions and extended to 3D spaces for more complex environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of Occupancy Grid Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational Complexity**: High-resolution grids can be computationally expensive to maintain and update, especially in large environments.\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: The memory requirements for storing high-resolution occupancy grids can be significant, particularly in 3D.\n",
    "- **Static Assumption**: Traditional occupancy grid mapping assumes a static environment, which may not be suitable for dynamic or rapidly changing environments without additional adaptations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupancy grid mapping is a fundamental technique in robotics and computer vision, providing a robust framework for environment representation and navigation. By discretizing space into a grid and updating the occupancy probabilities based on sensor data, occupancy grid mapping enables autonomous agents to build detailed maps of their surroundings, facilitating safe and efficient navigation. Despite its limitations, the method's versatility, probabilistic foundation, and scalability make it a cornerstone of modern autonomous systems.\n",
