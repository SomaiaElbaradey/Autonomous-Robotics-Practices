    "# Occupancy Grid Mapping Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This exercise implements a 2D occupancy grid mapping algorithm for robotics applications. The implementation processes laser scanner data and known robot poses to create a probabilistic map of the environment, distinguishing between occupied, free, and unknown spaces.\n",

    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- NumPy\n",

    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Occupancy Update Process\n",
    "1. Converts initial probabilities to log odds for numerical stability\n",
    "2. For each pose and corresponding range measurement:\n",
    "   - Converts range measurements to map coordinates\n",
    "   - Identifies cells along each laser beam using Bresenham's algorithm\n",
    "   - Updates log odds for each cell based on the inverse sensor model\n",
    "3. Converts final log odds back to probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate Systems\n",
    "- World coordinates: Robot's actual position in meters\n",
    "- Map coordinates: Discretized grid cells\n",
    "- Origin is at the center of the grid\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- The implementation assumes known robot poses\n",
    "- Uses log odds for numerical stability in probability updates\n",
    "- Employs Bresenham's line algorithm for ray tracing\n",

    "\n",
    "## Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Usage**: For large environments or fine resolutions, consider:\n",
    "   - Increasing map resolution (larger `map_res`)\n",
    "   - Processing data in batches\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**: To improve processing speed:\n",
    "   - Vectorize operations where possible\n",
    "   - Use numpy's optimized functions\n",
    "   - Consider implementing ray tracing in C++ if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Numerical Stability**: The implementation uses log odds to prevent numerical underflow/overflow in probability calculations\n",
